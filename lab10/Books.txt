The seventh edition of this comprehensive anthology addresses the two key issues confronted by students approaching Shakespeare today:
 
(1) a lack of knowledge about the historical period and;
(2)  difficulty with the language of Shakespeare's plays.
 
David Bevington's richly illustrated general introduction offers insight into Shakespeare's England and background on the literary, social, and cultural contexts in which Shakespeare wrote and produced plays. Each play is introduced by a descriptive essay designed to help students appreciate the historical contexts and interpretive issues raised by the play, without dictating students' interpretations. Completely revised and updated notes and glosses support student readers line by line, paraphrasing Elizabethan expressions in clear and accessible contemporary language.,1

Literature and the Writing Process combines the best elements of a literature anthology with those of a handbook to guide students through the interrelated process of analytical reading and critical writing.
 
The authors of Literature and the Writing Process hold to one simple premise: great literature–always thought-provoking, always new–offers a valuable path to teaching both writing and critical thinking skills.  By seamlessly integrating literature and composition into one multi-purpose text, this approach serves the dual process of enabling students both to enjoy, understand, and learn from imaginative literature; and to write clearly, intelligently, and correctly about what they have learned.   Text writing assignments use literature as a tool of critical thought, a method for analysis, and a way of communicating ideas.  This approach emphasizes writing as the focus of the book with literature as the means to write effectively.

Organized by writers’ purposes (to explain, to evaluate, to argue, etc.), The Prentice Hall Guide for College Writers foregrounds rhetorical awareness and asks students to consider their purpose, audience, and genre every time they write. In each “writing project” chapter, they are also walked through the process of inventing, researching, drafting, peer reviewing and revising.

Never before seen in the handbook market, The DK Handbook’s design is a true marriage of visual and textual content, in which each topic is presented in self-contained, two-page spreads for at-a-glance referencing. Explanations are concise and “chunked” to be more approachable and appealing for today’s readers, and accompanying visuals truly teach – making concepts and processes visible to students. The ground-breaking layout creates a consistent look and feel that helps students connect with the material, find information, and recognize solutions to writing problems they often don’t have names for.
 
In addition to the groundbreaking design, The DK Handbook provides the content that students need. With more attention to research—particularly online research—than other handbooks, DK gives students a solid foundation in information literacy. The handbook also presents grammar and documentation (MLA, APA, CMS and CSE) in new ways that makes the material more accessible, including unique “pattern pages” that help students grasp principles visually.

Henry’s Writing for Life offers a visually rich, high-interest, and down-to-earth approach that reinforces the writing process while showing students how to take responsibility for their learning.
 
While the areas-for-learning are often steadfast, today’s developing writers learn differently than learners from 10, 15, 20 years ago. The overwhelming majority of today’s learners—having been influenced by television, interacted with the Web, and watched video games—are products of an environment where information is presented and ideas are expressed principally through visuals. D.J. Henry recognized the differences between today’s learners and learners of yesteryear, and wrote Writing for Life from the ground up to address the thinking and learning processes occurring today.
 
The ground-breaking design of Writing for Life (developed in conjunction with Dorling Kindersley Publishers [DK]) makes writing, reading and thinking processes visible, and shows the processes rather than just telling students about them. Highly graphic layouts and unique visual pedagogy empower students to transfer the learning strategies they already use in interpreting the visual world to the task of writing. This visual approach—created specifically for today’s visually-oriented learners-is complemented by the student-centered learning strategy called “What’s the Point?” Not only does "What's the Point?" demonstrate real-world scenarios or applications of writing in context, but this directed thinking activity also prompts students to set a learning goal, call on prior knowledge, predict information, focus on structure, and generate details for each writing lesson. Thus, the visual approach and the “What's the Point?” theme of Writing for Life inspire student-centered learning and motivation by illustrating the power of writing in life.

Originally written to help college readers develop into independent learners, Bridging the Gap has kept up with the demands of contemporary college reading courses by evolving the “bridge” theme. Brenda expanded on this concept by creating schema for content courses with academic readings, and ultimately linking textbook readings to recent news in the popular press and representing new “bridges” of text-to-text, text-to-world, and text-to-self. All the while, Brenda never lost sight of what is important to both college reading instructors and students: comprehensive skill instruction, dependable exercises and examples, vocabulary development, and wealth of high-interest readings (pulled from a variety of academic disciplines) that provide meaningful practice.

Essentials of Processes, Systems, and Information with SAP Tutorials provides a concise introduction to MIS with a hands-on approach to business processes. 

Authored by Earl H. McKinney, Jr. and David M. Kroenke, the text shows students exactly how businesses use information systems and technology to accomplish their goals, objectives, and competitive strategy. Packed with examples of business situations, both real and fictitious, the book helps students understand what business systems actually are—and see why they are so important.

The text consists of the five SAP-focused chapters from McKinney and Kroenke’s Processes, Systems, and Information: An Introduction to MIS. A pair of appendices after chapters four and five contains SAP process exercises that enable students to get hands-on experience applying what they’re learning in the course. This clear emphasis on business processes, and SAP in particular, makes Essentials of Processes, Systems, and Information the ideal text for courses attended by students not majoring in MIS.,1

Gerard Roland’s new text, Development Economics, is the first undergraduate text to recognize the role of institutions in understanding development and growth. Through a series of chapters devoted to specific sets of institutions, Roland examines the effects of institutions on growth, property rights, market development, and the delivery of public goods and services and focuses. With the most comprehensive and up to date treatment of institutions on development, Roland explores the important questions of why some countries develop faster than others and why some fail while others are successful.
 
Roland also introduces the latest research related to randomized program evaluation and how it can be used to evaluate different aid programs. What is the effect of de-worming drugs on school participation and learning? How effective are bed nets in fighting malaria? Program evaluation helps determine which programs are best, and which policies have the best ratio in achieving goals of health, education, welfare, and other measures of development. 
 
Organized in three key parts, Roland begins by introducing the big issues of development. The second part gives a through treatment of the economics of institutions and why they matter, and the third analyzes development outcomes while building on the institutional framework introduced in part two.
